This test as it stands for the oflux revision it's being checked
into shows a bug.  It passes a shared pointer from the source
node to the sucessor NS.  When there is an i/o mismatch, ie. an
extra output parameter from the source node that the NS
node isn't specifying in its input node argument list then
an extra copy of the shared pointer is created and it seems
it never goes away as the memory the shared_ptr is holding
never gets deleted.

If you then add int bar to the NS node arguments the bug
goes away and things work as expected.
