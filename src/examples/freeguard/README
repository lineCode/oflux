A free guard is one that has no synchronization rules (like mutual
exclusion).  Such a guard must be handled with great care.
It should not be asked to grow with new (key,value) pairs once the
runtime is started.  In addition concurrent access of any
existing (key,value) pair should be made safe by external means (lock-free
or other techniques).
