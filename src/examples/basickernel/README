This example was motivated by a bug discovered in boxs plugins.
Essentially the XML loader at the time was pushing function-maps (which 
hold I/O conversion function pointers ---among other things) into a vector
(used as a stack).  The problem was that two plugins P1 and P2
which only depend on the kernel might define (in their own namespaces)
OFluxUnion(X+1) etc (the kernal having defined from 1 to X).
This capture between the two plugins (which _should_ be independently buildable), was making the load of the XML files fail: an I/O conversion of P1 
got used in both P1 and P2 (erroneously).

The datastructure used to maintain the function-maps was changed to be 
traversed only in USES-order (so you do not look at the function-maps of
plugins that you do not use!
