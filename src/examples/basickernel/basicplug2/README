This plugin just defines an input hook that takes an integer.

The interesting thing about it is that it uses B2 in an I/O-conversion
necessary position.  The B2 type will expect (assert otherwise) to only 
pass NULLs.  This will catch a mistake in the I/O conversion if a
similar one frmo another plugin is used (by mistake).
