This example shows a flow with highly non-uniform blocking and compute
behaviour.  It is meant to showcase the idea of detaching nodes and the 
tradeoffs of this feature. 

The Fibonacci node is highly compute intensive, but also completely without
side-effect (need for global resources).  Detaching it makes the CPUs work
harder since more compute jobs are dispatched.

The Sleep node is just a big blocking call.  Detaching it causes more of these 
nodes to run, but their effect is pretty neglible.

Please do mess with the detached states of the nodes and even try to introduce splaying -- for fun (and learning).
