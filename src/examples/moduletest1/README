This example demonstrates the use of the oflux module system.
It allows for:

* modules that use others (BMod uses CMod)

* guards that are unified across modules into one in the program 
  (see the CMod instance)

* libraries (.a s) are the compilation targets so that we can build with
  C++ in the usual/normal way (efficiently).

* each module's code lives in a namespace of the very same name (AMod's
  code is in the AMod namespace)

* abstract nodes are explicitly declarable to allow you to hook into 
  a module's unimplemented node.

* such hooks can be ignored with the terminate command.
