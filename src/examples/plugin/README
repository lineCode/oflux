Example kernal flow.

There is a RequestSrc source node which leads into a HandleRequest abstract node.  In turn that node leads to a default concrete Execute node.  That leads to a finalizing Sink node.

Each plugin is presented individually as an "edit" onto the kernal or a previous (dependent) plugin.  At load time the dependencies are resolved and the overall flow is constructed.

Important:  The point of using plugins is that they are 
independent build artifacts from the central (e.g. kernal) flow.
This has all kinds of advantages (build independence between unrelated plugins) and packaging of the overall product into a kernal + series of plugin features.
