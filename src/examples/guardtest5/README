As of the time of this checkin this test has an issue.
The node NS will not be run.  It seems that if you
have an indexed guard with at least 5 elements and one
node attempts to take this guard more than once with
different index values it hangs.  Looking at the 
.xml file the same guardref gets generated for both
guard instances and I think it hangs trying to acquire
that "same" guard a second time.
